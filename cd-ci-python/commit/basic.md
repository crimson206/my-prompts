Follow conventional commit rules when writing the title.

If there's a description for the category, follow that guideline.

Otherwise, write according to AI's discretion.

If there are many changes or important ones, a body will also be written.

The body will also be added to changelog or release notes,

so it's preferred to write only when absolutely necessary.
