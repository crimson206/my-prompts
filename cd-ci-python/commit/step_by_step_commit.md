When a developer has made many modifications at once, proceed with commits according to the instructions here.

Use git status to understand the overall changes.

Git add files with the same category.

Use git diff --staged to observe the actual changes in the staged files.

Write the commit message in a file called commit_message.md,

and use git commit -F commit_message.md to complete the commit of the added files.

Repeat the above process for the remaining changed files. commit_message.md should be overwritten each time.
